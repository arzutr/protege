# Installing Protégé on Linux

Protégé {{site.version}} is distributed in the form of a ```tar.gz``` file from the Protege Website, and includes the 64-bit Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It's therefore not necessary to have Java pre-installed on your computer to run Protege.  

To install Protégé:

1. Go to the [software page](http://protege.stanford.edu/software.php#desktop-protege) on the Protege website.
2. Click the **Download for Linux** button to download the tar.gz file to your machine.
3. Unpack the archive. To do this, either use your file explorer and double-click on the archive, and extract it to the desired location, or type in a terminal window:

     ```
     tar zxvf protege-{{site.version}}-linux.tar.gz
     ```
4. Launch Protégé.  To launch Protege Desktop, double-click on the **run.sh** in the ''Protege folder'' in the file explorer, or type **run.sh** in a terminal window, once you have changed the directory to the Protege folder.
